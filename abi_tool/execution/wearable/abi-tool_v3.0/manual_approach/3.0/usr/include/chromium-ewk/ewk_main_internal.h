/**
 * Set argument count and argument vector.

 * Must be called before the following APIs:\n
 * ewk_view_add\n
 * ewk_view_add_in_incognito_mode\n
 * ewk_view_add_with_context\n
 * ewk_view_add_with_session_data\n
 * ewk_context_default_get\n

 *
 * This API allows passing application arguments to the engine.
 * Also there is possible to add custom parameters. However,
 * the engine expects *original* application arguments
 * to remain unchanged. Passing copy of them using strdup and friends
 * is prohibited. The recommended way to call this API is:
 *
 * int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
 *   ewk_set_arguments(argc, argv);
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * or
 *
 * int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
 *     char* arg_options[] = {
 *       argv[0],
 *       "my_custom_param_1",
 *       "my_custom_param_2",
 *     };
 *     int arg_cnt = sizeof(arg_options) / sizeof(arg_options[0]);
 *     ewk_set_arguments(arg_cnt, arg_options);
 * }
 *
 * @note Calling the function for the second time has no user-visible effect.
