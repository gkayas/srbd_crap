/**
 * Append specified flag to chromium command line. This method should
 * be called after @ewk_set_arguments, but before @ewk_init. Calling it
 * after @ewk_init won't have any affects as in most cases chromium has
 * already processed most command line parameters.
 *
 * @deprecated Deprecated since Tizen 3.0.
 * This has been deprecated due to it was exposed on the internal needs.
 * Secondly, this function can not add command line switches defined as pair
 * (flag=value).
 * If there is a need to pass command line param it can be achieved
 * by ewk_set_arguments.
 *
 * @param flag Chromium command line flag
 *
 * @returns EINA_TRUE in case the call succeeded, EINA_FALSE in case it
 *     was called before ewk_set_arguments, or the flag argument was NULL.
